<h1>Spanish Resources -- Incomplete</h1>
<p>Channles, series, music, and other resources i recommend for learning spanish</p>

<h2>Youtube</h2>
<h3>Interview</h3>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/EasySpanish">EasySpanish</a> is great, good beginning resource and allows you to hear real people speaking spanish, includes substitles in english</li>
</ul>

<h3>Comedia</h3>
<ul>

  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/backdoor">Backdoor</a> Even funnnier funny mexican comedy channel</li>
</ul>

<h3>Grammatica</h3>
https://www.youtube.com/c/Gringoespanol

this guy is good cause he’s white so explains it clearly to the gringo listener, watched a lot of his vids early on

https://www.youtube.com/c/MariaEspa%C3%B1ol
https://www.youtube.com/c/1001reasonstolearnspanishwithus

I like these two as well, they do specific lessons, answer specific questions and i feel like it’s clear(er)


<h3>Historia/Viaje</h3>

https://www.youtube.com/c/AlexTienda

This guy is very famous in LA, does history/informational videos


<h2>Websites</h2>

https://www.spanishdict.com/
https://context.reverso.net/traduccion/

these two websites are great, spanishdict gives you 100% the correct translation even with breakdowns by spanish country and works offline, context-reverse is great too cause it just picks passages to translate in place words and shows you the entire sentence in spanish.




<h2>Consejos (Advice)</h2>

Series

Narcos (Mexico y Colombia)
El Chapo
Harina
Casa de papel

Consejos (advice)

1. Try to learn in a fun/entertaining way otherwise it will be solely frustration and you will be discouraged
2. When it comes time to speak/write just do that to the best of your ability, then later on maybe look up words, don’t try to speak perfectly
3. Focus on listening and speaking, more important than reading/writing (as you would basically be doing those things effectively anyway)
