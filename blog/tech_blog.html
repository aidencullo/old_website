Today I am going to attempt to resolve the brightness issue on my Windows 10 boot on:

Computer:
Lenovo Thinkpad T470
Processor:		i7
RAM:			8GB
System type:	64 bits

Operating System
Edition: 		Windows 10 Pro
Version: 		21H2
Experience: 	Windows Feature Experience Pack

Really don't know how useful any of those specifications will be, but just in case anyone is comparing to their own installation.

I have to preface this blog post by saying i have very little experience with Windows, not to mention Windows 10 so i will be making observations along the way.
