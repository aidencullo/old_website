    <h2> specs </h2>
    2015 macbook pro, macOS Catalina (10.15.7)
    
    <h2> Description</h2>
    
    <p>
      I've been trying to utilize native mac keyboard shortcuts to speed
      up app navigation and manipulation. I'll share here the most
      pertinent and useful shortcuts i've come across.
    </p>
    <p> I want to look more into navigating through apps as right now i
      really just tab around, but i know there are easier/quicker ways.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Chrome</h2>

    <p> Chrome is my primary browser and I really want to navigate it
      easier, i always find that I want to highlight the search bar or
      some element without having to use the mouse or tab a million
      times. I also really don't want to use the arrow keys either cause
      it's slower.
